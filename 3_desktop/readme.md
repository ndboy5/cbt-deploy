This is just a demo for the Desktop user for the xamjack application born out of 
pure boredom :)


Dependencies 
: lib ncurses
install with sudo apt-get install ncurses-dev      (for the apt-get people)
: lib curl
install with sudo apt-get install libcurl4-gnutls-dev

To compile this application, use 
gcc -o xj_desktop xj_desktop.c -lcurl -lncurses
To run
./xj_desktop

Cheers !!!

NB: sorry did'nt use the ncurses again, got tired. 



For non nix users, you may need to compile from source  :) :) :) :)
